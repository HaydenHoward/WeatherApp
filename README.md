# Overview

A simple React project to be introduced to the Framework and get an understanding what I can create. Learning how to connect my web app with an api and display different data based on the user input.

I made simple Weather app that displays the Location, Temperature, Weather, what the temperature Feels Like, Humidity, and Wind Speed. To open this you need to use node.js and use NPM start to open up the localhost server to view the web page. 

I enjoy the outdoors and wanted to do something in that theme. I was looking at different APIs that I could use to practice using them in React and found the OpenWeather API.
