# Overview

A simple React project to be introduced to the Framework and get an understanding what I can create. Learning how to connect my web app with an api and display different data based on the user input.

I made simple Weather app that displays the Location, Temperature, Weather, what the temperature Feels Like, Humidity, and Wind Speed. To open this you need to use node.js and use NPM start to open up the localhost server to view the web page. 

I enjoy the outdoors and wanted to do something in that theme. I was looking at different APIs that I could use to practice using them in React and found the OpenWeather API.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

The page on my web app displays the weather. All the numbers on the page change based on the location that the user puts into the search bar at the top of the web page. 

# Development Environment

OpenWeather API, Geo API, and GitHub

React, Node, HTML, and CSS
